Bring agenda's to the meetings.
Mainly meant so we get the most out of his time.

Our requirements are the rubric that will be used to determine if the product is finished.
The sooner the requirements are done the better.

Current requirements are unclear.
Should be more clear how the system works:
	How should each system connect with all the subfunctions?
	You can't just say "there will be a notification" How does that notification system work / where can you see it.

User stories are not functional requirements.
	Can't read "As a TA I want to" as it is too vague to grade.
	Should look more like the functional requirements document from brightspace.
	Functional requirements are the lower levels of the user stories.
	They are meant to clearly convey how the user stories are implemented -> clients will usually assume it uses the most perfect solution while we as developers might go for a good enough solution.
	
	requirements need to be more balanced. Somewhat equal Musts/Shoulds and perhaps Coulds
	Split tasks on granularity (M: there is a list of students who need to be notified, S: Sends email or something C: raise notifications via API)

	Schema's graphs, how does everything interact: Context maps? We need visuals.

A bad microservice cuts things off because its getting too large
A good microservice was thought out in advance.
High/low demand services.

We're using scrum and we're recommended to rotate the scrum master. This means we have to estimate times properly.
TA will be checking that everybody does the same amount of work -> problems within the group should be reported as soon as possible.
TA is on your side when grading, this means we have to give them plenty of information when stuff goes south on time so they can reason with course staff.

Criteria:
	how do you split your work? not a 2 man team with 4 cheering
	how on track of our own requirements are we
	how do we implement scrum

RN it is better to overshoot how technical we should get untill he tells us to dial it back.
Slides trump the TA.

At the end of the day our process matters, not the product.
