Notes TA meeting:

-He liked the task definition: seems good:

Reflections:
-We lack dates on reflections for sprints
-Get clear, concrete actions to do instead of vagues
-We need to bring code feedback from our feedback parts into other parts of code for excellent

Code quality:
-Method length -> good
-

To get the builder pattern "counting" for design patterns we need to create them yourselves (not @Builder)

ApplicationService -> change name for this (vague names) + "There are others"

There are some complicated if-else trees in the code we could maybe replace with switch statement

Testing:
Put all integration tests maybe in an integration folder so it's clear what is an integration test and where they are
Excellent: The integration between microservices is extensively tested (between every pair) {Maybe mock on both sides and see if they're the same}

Functional system level testing: 
-Create a doc that specifies where functional cases are tested.
-(Same for software testing, create a file where everything is tested)

-Create numerical boundary tests to test "corner" cases or define where a boundary is being tested (//BoundaryTest or maybe put in javadoc of that method)

-Tooling & Code review == excellent

Assignment:
-Implement builder pattern?
