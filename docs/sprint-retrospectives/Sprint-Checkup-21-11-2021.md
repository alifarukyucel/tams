Need to decide on db schema until we can decide how to receive notifications.

make schema, seperates the microservices, the endpoints they expose, the data they store.

All requests if possible should allow aggregates.

focus on getting the booleans: has course finished approving ta, is ta approved or not, contract has boolean that says signed.

We do not want to focus on email right now, keep it as a could have.

selection procedure starts 3 weeks before the course starts (ask the TA for confimation)

Need a place for visualization:
We will be using figma so make sure to join the team posted in general.
Look into lolipop notation

Scrum master creates the agenda for the TA meeting that week.
Each microservice is in it's own directory.
update your intelliJ

To setup your checkstyle
If it doesn't grab it automatically you can go like this:
File -> settings -> search checkstyle -> under tools you'll see Checkstyle -> Configuration File -> Click the plus icon
